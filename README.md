# Calculator

## Description:
In this project, the advanced calculator was created in the python environment. I did not use any libraries, my own module was created using mathematical formulas.

When we run the code, it asks us to enter the number of the operation we want to do. The numbers are printed on the screen as follows:
1. Addition
2. Extraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Percentage
6. Exponentian
7. Rooting
8. Logarithm
9. Ln
10. Factorial
11. Sinus
12. Cosinus
13. Tangent
14. Cotangent


Then it asks the appropriate question for the selected operation.(Some operations require two numbers, while others may require degrees or base.) I added the code below:
